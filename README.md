# 📚 Python Exercises – Duplicates in Lists

This repository contains simple solutions to logic problems using Python. The first exercise implements a function to find duplicate numbers in a list.

### 🔍 Current Exercise

**`find_duplicates(nums)`**  
This function takes a list of numbers (`nums`) and returns a new list containing only the numbers that appear more than once.

#### Example:
```python
from duplicates import find_duplicates

print(find_duplicates([1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4]))  # Output: [1, 2]
```

### Current Structure

```

├── duplicates.py       # File with the find_duplicates function
├── README.md           # This file
```

### Next Steps

- Add more functions and exercises.
- Organize by category (lists, dictionaries, strings, etc.).
- Write automated tests for the exercises.

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
